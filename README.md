# KNN-classifier
Simple KNN_classifier model applied on a classified and unscaled Data.  Introduction:  This is just a simple KNN_classifier model applied on a unscaled Data. I did this project in order to test my scaling skills and also create a model to fit the unscaled data. For scaling purposes I have used sklearn library and imported the Scaler module. Also I have used a simple for loop in order to plot the error rate with the number of classifiers that we are using in the model. Contents:  I have used a simple unscaled data in a csv file. Cleaned the data using basic pandas dataframe options. Then scaled the data using the sklearn Scaler model. After scaling, I splitted the data into training and testing segments using the train-test-split model of sklearn. I applied the KNN model for n_neighbours=1 and then calculated my accuracy for this model. The accuracy comes out to be 92%. Now using a for loop i calculated the error rate for different values of numbers of classifiers and plotted against error rate. From the graph, I chose the value 33 as the optimal value of KNN_classifier to give the best accuracy. The optimal accuracy comes out to be 95%. Conclusion: I concluded that for an unscaled data scaling is always the most important thing.And after scaling of the data it can be easily fed into any machine learning model.
